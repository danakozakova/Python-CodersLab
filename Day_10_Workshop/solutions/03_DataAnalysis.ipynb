    "Below is a brief description of each column in our dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Name**: The name of the team participating in the match.\n",
    "- **Year**: The year in which the season takes place.\n",

    "- **Losses**: The number of matches lost by the team in the given season.\n",
    "- **OT Losses**: The number of matches lost by the team in overtime in the given season.\n",
    "- **Win %**: The percentage of matches won by the team in the given season.\n",
    "- **Goals For (GF)**: The number of goals scored by the team in the given season.\n",
    "- **Goals Against (GA)**: The number of goals conceded by the team in the given season.\n",
    "- **+ / -**: The difference between the number of goals scored and conceded by the team in the given season.\n",

    "> Note: At this stage, certain significant simplifications were intentionally made in the analysis and they will not be explicitly mentioned, aiming for a discussion at the end of the workshop."
